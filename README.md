# Stock-Prices-vs-Economic-Indicators
This project analyzies the Impact of COVID-19 on the Correlation Between Classic Economic Indicators and Monthly Median Stock prices.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of people across the world.
Industries from energy to healthcare have undergone drastic changes because of the pandemic. The New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) has experienced unparalleled growth during the pandemic, despite many industries being negatively impacted by the pandemic, 
American federal debt being higher than ever, and there being abnormally high
uncertainty about everything (Bloomberg).

The US experienced grave unemployment during the first couple months of the pandemic, yet many speculate
that the outflow of stimulus checks, the less busy schedules of individuals, and the ease with which one can access
the stock exchange through apps like Robinhood has led to this unexpected growth. Investors have put more money
into stocks in the last 5 months than in the previous 12 years combined (CNBC ). The average consumer spending
patterns have grown to include investments in the stock market. The S&P 500 gained more than 16 percent in 2020,
a very strong return during a year of nationwide lock downs and steep job losses in the United States (Washington
Post).

Altogether, so far, the stock market during the pandemic can be summarised in one word: unexpected. Classic
economic indicators such as unemployment rate and number of unemployed persons per job opening have been used
as predicting factors for the stock exchange throughout history (Allen). However, during the pandemic, each indicator
experienced extreme swings unlike anything in recent history. This led us to question the difference in the correlation
between median monthly stock prices and classic economic indicators between August 2018 to December 2019 (a
period of seventeen months before COVID-19 began) versus the seventeen months during the peak of COVID, from
April 2020 to August 2021.

Since the pandemic could not have been predicted, we want to know whether the median monthly NYSE price
actionâ€™s correlation to unemployment rates and unemployed per job opening statistics was impacted by COVID-19.
This project will attempt to answer the research question: How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the
correlation between median monthly stock prices and the classic economic indicators of Unemployment Rates and Number of Unemployed Persons per Job Opening?
